# Code Structure Guidelines

## Directory Organization
- Page components go in `app/`
- Reusable components go in `components/`
- Utilities and hooks go in `lib/`
- Data layer code goes in `db/`

## Clean Code Principles
- No barrel files (index.ts)
- Import directly from source files
- Avoid obvious or redundant comments
- Comments should only explain complex logic or non-evident decisions
- No TODOs or incomplete code in production

## Component Guidelines
- Prefer server-side components by default
- Use 'use client' only when necessary
- Keep components small and focused
- Follow component-specific patterns for each technology
